# About Aerofit

Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.
# Project Overview
This project explores data from a fitness equipment business to uncover key patterns, detect anomalies, and derive actionable insights for better strategic decision-making. The analysis focuses on customer behavior, sales performance, and operational efficiency.

# Business Problem

The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

### Objectives
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand sales, customer behavior, and product performance.
  - Detect outliers that may indicate unusual sales patterns or operational inefficiencies.
  - Apply statistical analysis to derive business-critical metrics.
  - Use probability analysis to forecast future trends and customer purchase behavior.
